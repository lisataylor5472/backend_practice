This is an attempt to make a practice exercise.
Yesterday we talked a bit about nested hashes
so I want you guys to practice making some nested
hashes.

In the nested_hashes.rb

1. Create a hash called states
2. Within the states hash, create 2 separate nested
   hashes with the keys set equal to 2 states of
   your choice.
3. Within each of the hashes set equal to the states
   you chose, create 2 additional hashes set equal
   a city that state has.
4. Try to call the specific information within
   the hash all the way down to a city.


Extra Challenge!

Create an array within a states hash with the elements set
equal to the 3 most populated cities.
